# What can be found in this folder?

All my previous experiments were run with Colab Pro +, this folder contains some of the notebooks which were used during project development phase. All the notebooks in this folder are reproducible, each of them is standalone, although they use/store data at Google Drive (so if you want to rerun them, change the locations according to your personal setup). 

## Training notebooks

- `train_loco_split_single_domains.ipynb`
